# Food Calculator

A simple food calculator built with React and Tailwind.

## Notes

Majority was written using cursor (playing around with it).

Great to use for tracking what sushi people ate.

Overall feeling: Needs a lot of guidance but does the job. New projects works extremely well.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
